Is there a way to optimize and store the Journeys on the S3 bucket (review what we do with audio messages in the text conversation module- AI Chat Assistant) so that when we revisit the page it doesnt regenerate the journey everytime and maybe for other users at similar difficulty we can reference other older generated ones? Initially we would want to generate as much as possible but then as time goes on, we will pull from the data set more so then less AI generated
